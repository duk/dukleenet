My name is Duk and I build websites for a living. I am currently focusing on UX part of things; JavaScript and CSS in general. I am well versed with
most UI frameworks. I guess you can label me as "full stack developer."

In the past, I've worked with .NET stack and Java stack at various companies.

I am interesetd in cloud; it seems like a field where most things look difficult, but actually not that difficult.

Also interested in machine learning, probably not going to be able to get a job since I do not have phd in Math or what not. But I like figuring things out using data.
