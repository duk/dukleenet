The truth about relationship is that once you pass like 25 years old, it's near impossible to make a new friend. Personally I don't put that much value on friends unlike others. I think it's important for friends to have common interests. And that's why I can never be comfortable with parents of my children's parents; only common thing we have is that our kids are friends.
