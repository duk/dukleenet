I need to go back to basics. Let's not get fascinated by shiny objects. In old days, you could just know a tool in tech world and be okay with it; there weren't that many tools then.

But now there are so many. It's overwhelming. And this is what I think I should do.

1. Focus on basics. Spend my time learning algorithms, data structures, C programming language. Foundations matter.
2. Pick a tool that's most comfortable for me. Users do not care what tools I use. They just want the result.
3. Always learning.

Then I think I will be ok.
