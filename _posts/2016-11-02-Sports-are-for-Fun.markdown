Listen to [this part](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-ks8G-Y13NSYVNmekpqbFlna2s/view?usp=sharing) of The Herd's podcast yesterday.

What Colin is saying is so true. Sports are still important to get the kids to exercise and allow them to learn other things that matter in life; leadership skills, how to work
in groups and what not. But our focus shouldn't be about using it as a tool to get into a college or we shouldn't push our kids to playing them well and playing them all the time.

I am guilty as charges when it comes to it. I wasn't crazy enough to enroll my son to a travel team or any of that nature. But I am done with all that. So here are some things
I am going to do when it comes to my kids and playing sports.

1. Never push to do certain sports that they do not want to play.
2. At least pick a sport that they like and a sport that has other benefits. For example, tennis is a good sport. You can play that for a long time. Golf is a good sport. Baseball
is a bad sport. Football is a bad sport. Help them to pick a life-long sport.

And some people are suspecting that quality of pro sports is going down and I wonder if that has something to do with sport crazy parents. My assumption is that parents push kids to
sports so hard that some kids make it to professional level. But since it wasn't organic, they aren't just that great of an athlete. So overall quality of sports is going down.
This year only 25 MLB players hit above 300 whereas 53 players in 2000*.

I tell my kids all the time. Being a pro athlete is almost impossible; it starts with physical gift. And studying is the easiest way to succeed.


*I know 2000 might be a roid era. But I doubt that roid helps you with a batting average.
