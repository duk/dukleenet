Bullying is bad. If your kid is doing it to other kids, make sure you put a stop to it. You can't really make your kid smarter, but your job as a parent is to make sure your kids are civil. So that at least they can make a living being a scrum master.

Here is a good paragraph what your kids should learn from "12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos" by Jordan B. Peterson.

> Here are some suggestions. Do not bite, kick or hit, except in self-defence. Do not torture and bully other children, so you don’t end up in jail. Eat in a civilized and thankful manner, so that people are happy to have you at their house, and pleased to feed you. Learn to share, so other kids will play with you. Pay attention when spoken to by adults, so they don’t hate you and might therefore deign to teach you something. Go to sleep properly, and peaceably, so that your parents can have a private life and not resent your existence. Take care of your belongings, because you need to learn how and because you’re lucky to have them. Be good company when something fun is happening, so that you’re invited for the fun. Act so that other people are happy you’re around, so that people will want you around. A child who knows these rules will be welcome everywhere.
