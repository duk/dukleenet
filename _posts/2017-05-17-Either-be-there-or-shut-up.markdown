My wife volunteers me for my son's class once in a while. And I do not mind doing it since it's for my son. But I start noticing that it's usually the same people who volunteer all the time. So there are free loaders.

If I live in a poor neighborhood, I would understand it. But I don't. Most people in my neighborhood are highly educated and therefore have great jobs.

So you choose not to volunteer. So you let other parents to do the work for your own child. Then you sit in your comfy office and keep texting me to report back on how your son is doing.

Either be there or shut up.
