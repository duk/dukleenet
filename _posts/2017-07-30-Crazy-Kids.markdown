I don't know what it is, but the younger generation's children seem crazier. Based on a few parenting books, children who do not get enough parents attention tend to get more hyperactive.

Get off your fucking phone and pay attention to your kids once awhile. You are thier fucking parents after all. And they tell me "I don't know why my son is so out of control" And I am thinking 'that's exactly why he is. You have no fucking clue how to raise a kid' 

I can handle obnoxious kids, but what I can't handle are violent kids. Keep your fucking kids under control. I already know that your kid will grow up to become nobody, but at least don't let him hurt somebody else's kid.
