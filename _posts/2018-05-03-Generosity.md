In "Principles" by Ray Dalio, there is a rule called "Be generous and expect generosity from others"

> a. Be generous and expect generosity from others. If you're not generous with others and others aren't generous with you, you won't have a quality relationship.

That's so true about a relationship. I don't really have that many friends and I don't use a word "friend" lightly as most people do. But I noticed there aren't that many generous people, they are really hard to find. I consider my wife and her family very generous. My wife invites people and cooks for people. She gets the best meat, best cake cooking for hours making me clean around the house. She always buys good gifts with gift receipts for other kids birthdays. She and I always donate our money and time for our kids classes. 

But other parents are cheap as shit. There are piles of birtday gifts in my house that my kids didn't even want to open; they are crap with no gift receipts. I know exactly what went through their mind. It's either regifting; of course shitty people have shitty friends. Or they bought these shitty gifts during some clearance sale in one of those huge oil barrel thingy they put in toy stores and they don't want us to find out they spent almost close to nothing. Never cared to ask their kids what my son or daughter would like. Just grabbed the cheapest possible toy in order to just bring shit. 

But hey, it's the thought that counts. Yes, if you live in poor neighbor hood wondering where your next meal would come from. We live in bay are and you fucking drive Tesla. 

My son knows this kid and his Dad works from home. And I just haven't seen his fucking face once in any volunteering event. My wife makes me to volunteer. That's what good wife does. But again shitty people end up with shitty people. 

Anyway, I almost ruined my wife hanging out with shitty people during my teenager years. So I closely watch what type of people my kids associate with. 

Here is the thing. I just need to look at their parents to see what type of kids they are.
