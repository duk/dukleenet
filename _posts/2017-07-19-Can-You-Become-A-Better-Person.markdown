I am beginning to doubt if that's even possible. I have not met a person that made me go 'wow he was crazy, but now he is awesome' not even once.

What everyone needs to do is not to try to change who you are, but to embrace who you are and try to do less of things that are not so great about you and do more of things that are so great about you. If you are a grumpy person like me, you will fail at trying to become a happy person; you do not have that makeup. Instead, figure out what ticks you off. Avoid those. Figure out what makes you less grumpy. Do more of those.

Embrace who you are.
