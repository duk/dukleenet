Recently I've started working on a web project on my free time. Then it hit me; now I am just a framework/library user especially when it comes to web design.
I hate the idea of my sites looking exactly like million other sites. But I just can't do it anymore.

So I am taking this opportunity to personally master CSS. If you want to become a developer who gets repects from peers, you have to understand how sausage is made.
Let's not limit ourselves to become just a user.
