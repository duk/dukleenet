I drove my son and some of his classmates to this Science fair at a High School near. And this is what I saw. Most high school kids were just goofing off, blowing things up, flipping bird at one another, cussing at each other. You know the typical stuff that high school kids do I guess. 

That's most people. I was one of them. Look where I ended up now. Some shitty company complaining and whining about work. Then I will die and be forgotten. It's hard to be great. It does take a long time to become great.
