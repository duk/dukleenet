I read a book called "Captivate" over this weekend, but I stopped in the middle of it. I do not force myself to finish a book. If it's deemed garbage, I stop reading; I value my time over finishing a dumb book.

Anyway, the book is about captivating people. While I was digging into the book, I couldn't stop thinking to myself, this book is telling its readers to be fake. So I am supposed to behave differently depending on what they are?
