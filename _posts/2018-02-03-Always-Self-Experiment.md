The very first question that you should ask yourself is "am I happy?"

If the answer is yes, you don't really have to do antyhing. You are already there.

But most people are not. So if you are not happy with your job, or whatever current situation is, you need to start self-experiment. And here are some pointers.

1. Alwasy start with getting healthy. Healthy body, then healthy mind. Trying to get inside normal BMI. You will be shocked how "skinny" you have to be to get inside the normal BMI zone. So you start experimenting with what you eat. That should be your first self-experiemtn subject; eating
2. Once you think you are healthy enough, you ask the same question. "Am I now happy?" Then figure out why you are not happy. For most adults, it's your job. So your 2nd self-experiment is "finding a better job that you think will make you happy" Research on "good" companies. What you don't want is a horizontal move; you want to go up, not go sideway. This 2nd self-experiment is the most important one, yet not that many people don't do. They tend to stay where they are and keep complaining about their job and the company. Your company is like your college; if you are in there you are not that much smarter than the rest. 

Your life should be this constant self-experiments. If you don't, you just get into this "bitching" mode that isn't helping anyone. If you don't get a job at better companies, current shtty company is where you belong. At least now you know. Self-realization is good. And you want to get to it as quickly as possible, so that you can plan accordingly.
