# Here is how I live my life.

1. Don't fuck with sleep. The most important thing. Do whatever it takes to get
   you well-rested. Buy a nice bed. Buy a nice pillow. Nice pillow makes a huge
   difference. Always experiment with what works and what doesn't. For me,
   getting a great pillow helped a lot. Also, planning to switch my bed to
   Casper. Already got one for my son. While he is away next week, I will sleep
   in his bed and see how it feels.
2. Work ealry in the moring. I usually in bed by 8:30 or so and I wake up around
   4 and I drink a cup of coffee with a lion mane mushroom. Then I get laser
   focused for about two hours. That's the most productive time of a day for me.
   Then my dog comes down and I walk him for an hour or so. But before walking
   him, I write down what to do next early morning. So that I don't get
   distracted.
3. There are two time buckets; one bucket is for my family and the other bucket
   is for me. And let's talk about those two buckets.

## Family Bucket.

1. The main key is to give them undivided attention. No fucking looking at your
   goddamn phone while talking to your kids. They don't need and want that much
   of your time, but when they do give it a 100%.
2. Whatever strenthen your family closer is time well spent. There is no such
   thing as stupid activity. Just be in the moment and have fun.

## My Bucket

1. my time should be only spent on personal improvement. I am a chicken shit. I
   don't take risks. And most people don't. The surest way to make a nice living
   without taking too much chance is to master your craft. Let's get into how to
   master something.

### How to master something

1. Get healthy. If you are not healthy, you can't master anything. If you think
   you are not, focus on getting healthy first.
2. Always learning new and refine what you already know. Learning a new stuff
   actually helps you with things that you already know and you thought you
   knew. It gives you different perspectives of looking at things.

3. Read books on behavior science. It's important to understand human and
   especially yourself.
