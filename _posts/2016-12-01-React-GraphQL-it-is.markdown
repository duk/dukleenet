[React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) is very mature now and there are so many great libraries that I can just leverage. And just watched a few YouTube videos on [GraphQL](http://graphql.org/) 
and I love the idea.

I've been entertaining using various shinier frameworks: Angular 2, Polymer, Elm, Vue & even Svelte. I realy love Polymer and I still believe that web component is 
the future. But for [my next project](https://workopenly.com) I will use React and GraphQL.
