There should be only two things that matter to you; youself and your family. I personally wouldn't even go further than immediate family as in your wife, your kids, your siblings and your parents.

And there is no truth. Everything that you belive in is something that you made up in your head by cherrypicking what you like. Pretty much everything that you think is truth is your opinion. There is no point arguing about it. Again you can never ever change other people's opinion. So why waste your time arguing about it.

I don't belive in God because I hate going to church on Sundays. I am too lazy. I am just not going church on Sundays and that makes me non-believer so be it. I worry about heaven and hell thing when I get there.

I am writing this blog because I just read about Sam Harris. My personal opinion of him is that he is a dick. There was one time he retweeted a minor's tweet trolling him. That incident tells me everything I need to know about the guy. 50 year old whoes skin is so thin that he couldn't help but retweeting a minor's trolling on him: that's a fucking loser in my book. So I don't really care what he thinks or how smart he is. I don't listen to dicks.

Anyway, stop caring about things don't matter to you. Stop listening to people who are just filled with hate and arrogance. It's just not healthy.

Repeat after me. There is no truth. Just opinions. Do not waste your time arguing about it. Just live your life the way you want as long as your way doesn't hurt others on the way.
