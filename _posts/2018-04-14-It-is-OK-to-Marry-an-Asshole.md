It's okay to marry an asshole, but it's your job to constantly remind him it's not okay to be one sometimes. My wife married to one. So I know how that feels. You feel like just giving up and let him just run all over you and your kids. But that's not okay. You should stand up for yourself and fight back. My wife does that shit every fucking day. "No it's not okay honey. They are YOUR family. You should go visit them" and so forth. It's sorry to see some folks just giving up after marrying to an asshole. Sad!
