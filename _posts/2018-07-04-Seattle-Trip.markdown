Just came back from Portland-Seattle Trip and it was a eye-opening experience for me on many levels. 

1. I will not travel again with people other than my core family. It's hectic, not fun and total waste of my vacation time. 
2. I will try not to rent a car. Just use Uber when needed.
3. I will not use Airbnb. My experience was not so great.
