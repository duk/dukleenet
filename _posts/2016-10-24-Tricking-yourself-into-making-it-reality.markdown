I don't think a lot of people "pretend" that they are smart; they honestly think that they are smart. These people always have 
some excuses as to why they didn't finish highschool or did not go to college; bad friends, bad parents, and what not. 

What if you are just not that smart? What if all these self-help books and media are feeding you this "lie" about "you can be anything
you want to be"? What if your life is already decided when you were born and there was little left for your desire and your will?

For example, let's say there is this self-help author who went through shitty life and finally figured out life and wrote a book about it? 

A lot of these help books are filled with nice feely stories about people who finally got it and made it. But they are not you. 
They are not me. What might have worked for them might not work for you.

So what we need to do as quickly as possible is to figure out what we are meant to be and do that well. We were not born as a clean slate;
we were born with certain purpose like everything else in the world. Are you built to be a doctor? Are you built to be an engineer? 
Are you built to be a social worker? Are you built to be a teacher?

The bottom line is we need to have a society where schools help kids to find their "callings" and systems that allow them to do what they
are born to do and make a decent living and raise a family.
