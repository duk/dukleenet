I don't want to feel bad in my own house. So if you make me feel bad in my own house, you are not getting invited back. Period. But I am your sister! Nope. Done. But he is your nephew. Nope. Done. I don't really give a fuck. You don't get a pass just because you share a blood line. 

I look at all these asshole kids and wonder to myself, 'wow it must be fucking hard to raise a decent human being.' I rarely see a decent child any more. If  their parent spends a little more time on his/her kid than spending time on fucking Instagram or Facebook, their child wouldn't be such a fucking dick. But here we are. 

I am done with trying to be nice. My life is now literally too short.
