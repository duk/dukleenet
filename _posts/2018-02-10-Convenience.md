Convenience doesn't improve anything. It's nice, but you have to know that it's not going to improve your life in a long run.

Googling stackoverflow, then copy and paste code snippet is "convenient", but you will never improve as a developer. 
Using social networks is "covenient", but you will never have a deeper relationship.
