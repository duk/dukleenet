A few days ago this business analyst sent an email to me asking to put in hours to my tasks. The thing is though our new CTO said we did not have to do that about a year ago. So I was confused. So I replied to him saying exactly that. Then He replied saying he "confirmed" with someone and now I had to do it. So I replied back asking him to tell me whom he "confirmed" that with.

Silence. On the side, I started confirming on my own.

Finally, he came clean saying he just wanted me to do it so that he could make pretty charts with it and asking if I could do that for him.

I don't know, dude. You lied to me. Only people I would let it slide when they lie to me are my family. And you are not. I don't know where we go from here. I can't trust you any more. Sorry.
