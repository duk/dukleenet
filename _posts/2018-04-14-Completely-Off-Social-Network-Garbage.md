Social Network shit is garbage. I quickly label people who think Facebook CEO smart as dumbfucks. Wait. dumb evil fucks to be exact. When you label someone, you should label based on their "positive" impact on our society. To me, he is an asshole who stole other twin dudes ideas and used people's personal data to enrich himself. And you think he is great. To me, that tells a lot about you; dumb evil fuck. 

Anyway, somehow I sorta liked artistic side of instagram and elitist feel of twitter, so I kept these two around for awhile. These two somehow managed to keep pulling me back in one way or another. "oh my gosh. Did you see my cousin's provocative instagram post?" and so forth. Then I kept getting these alert saying so and so just post whatever blah blah. Constant screaming to steal my attention so that they can put some promoted ad shit in front of my eyeballs.

I said to myself. That's it for me. I am going completely off on any social network garbage; it makes me feel stupid. And I don't feel like a stupid fuck who stare at social network app all fucking day like it matters. And so far it's been great. I get more shit done now. I get more focused time. And I suggest you do the same. I hope you don't want to stay dumb for the rest of your life.
