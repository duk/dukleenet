Couple of days ago, I listened to Sam Harris's podcast episode called ["Forbidden Knowledge."](https://www.samharris.org/podcast/item/forbidden-knowledge) He interviewed Charles Murray who wrote a book called "Bell Curve." 

To super simplify the book, the book says whites are more intelligent than blacks.

I still think Charles Murray is a racist since he couldn't really explain "why" he wrote the book when Sam Harris asked the question. But there are some interesting stuff in the podcast as well.

I am actually a believer of "a lot of things about me is predetermined by genes that I got from my Mother and Father." And if that's true, what's the point of "parenting"? Can I let my kids to do whatever they want to do everyday then? They will watch TV and play video games all day. Then again, is that in their genetic makeup that I would choose that over studying or doing other things that are productive?

I read an article about a kid who got accepted all ivy league schools and his Mom said his son used to go down to a basement and read old mathematics books for fun and she had to tell him to "stop" studying too much. Was he born that way? 

If I have a bad apple as my kid, there is no point trying to parent him to turn him into a good apple?
