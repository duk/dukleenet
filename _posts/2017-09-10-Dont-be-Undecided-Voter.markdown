You know what you want. Last episode of "Real Time with Bill Maher", this dude showed up from last election and talked about why he was undecided during the election. What really irked me was that he acted like he was a well-balanced person of some sort. No you are not. You know whom you would vote for already, but you are sitting on your fucking high chair as if you are so intelligent or some shit. In my bubble world, if you have to remotely struggle between anyone and a douchebag who said we should grab a woman by her pussy, you are dumb as fuck. Don't fucking tell me that that choice was a struggle and you had to collect FACTS from Fox News. 

Elections lately have become dumb fuckers moments to get even with people who decided to study when they were in school. I wonder if they knew most "thought leaders" on the right wing are also highly educated (but fucked up in their heads due to childhood trauma), but just using you dumbfucks as opportunity to enrich themselves.
