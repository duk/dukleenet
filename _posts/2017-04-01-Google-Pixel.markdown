Somehow I couldn't shake off my desire to give an android phone another chance. So I bought a Google Pixel XL and gave my newly purchased iPhone 7 plus to my wife. 

So here it goes. I think photos come out better. No more janky stuff that I saw in android a few years back. But there is always this feel that something is missing. I don't know what it is. Maybe it's more of a habit than not.

But it is an excellent phone.
