There are two types of science. "Real" and "fake." Most chemistry and physics are what I would call "real" science. And I don't pay much attention to "fake" ones. And when it comes to human bodies (especially brains) and genes and what not, they are close to fake. Yeah, they change their stance every year or so saying "well, technology wasn't there back then." Yes. That's exactly why I do not pay my attention when you say something with data you checkpick based on your belief. Just because the resource that was needed wasn't available that doesn't turn "false" to "true." You got it wrong so many times and I am not sure you will get right next time.

When it comes to this Google guy's rant meme about women are inferior in certain things, we should focus on his motive. If some asshole spends years to prove that white people are more intelligent than black people, what motivated him to do that shit should be the first thing that comes into your mind. So he is a sexist. There is no other way to put it; he depended on unverfiable science garbages to defend his position. Since we have no "real" science yet to figure our human genomes and its effects, you cannot scientifically back your hypothesis. So the best thing for you to do with your racist, sexist ideas is to shut up about it. Why? it's offensive. It hurts people. And it makes you come off as dumb fuck.
