First, I have to give this to Sam Haris; he is super smart. Of course, just like any other smart folks, he comes with a few quirks. 

In his "Waking up" podcast, he invited Scott Adams to debate about Donald Trump. Of course, Scott Adams got schooled.

These are the things that I came away from the debate.

1. Sam Harris is a lot more intelligent than Scott Adams.
2. When you have to bring up your credentials yourself to the debate, you alreay lost. At some point during the debate, Scott Adams brought up the fact that he was a Cal graduate. Well. Sam Harris went to Stanford and he has PHD. Sam didn't have to bring that up.
3. Sam Harris first stated his take on Donald Trump first then made arguments to support that whereas Scott Adams started off how smart he is for figuring out what Donald Trump is actually doing.
4. Sam Harris did not get emotional even after he admitted that this was an emotional topic. Scott Adams got emotional after starting off pretending to be a cool headed person.

There are two things in play in whatever everyone does. Everyone is a prisoner of his/her own confirmation bias and cognitive dissonance. And there are only two things a person can do about these two; recognize them and be aware or do not recognize them. Again, you can't escape no matter how hard you try. The best thing you can do is to be aware that you are doing exactly that.

Once you figured that out, any type of debate becomes silly. Everyone is just defending his/her belief using what they think is true. For example, Scott Adams "thinks" Donald Trump got elected because Donald Trump is one of the greatest pursuader we've ever seen. But that's just his opinion.
