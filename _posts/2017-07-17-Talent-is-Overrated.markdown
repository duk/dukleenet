So I started listhing to this book called "Talent is Overrated." This book falls into "IQ doesn't matter much. Talent doesn't matter much. Anybody can become anything if they put your mind to it." Then of course. Just like any other book with the same agenda does the author started listing all the "famous" people. 

First, nobody is denying that practice is useless. I stopped reading the book about 1/4 way in; I don't waste my time trying to finish a book that resonate with me. But to sum it all up, what the author is trying to say is that talent is overall a myth and deliberate practice is the way to go.

Here is what I belive. 

1. Success has a lot to do with "luck." You were lucky to be born into a family. You were luck to meet right mentors. You were lucky to have your genes. You were lucky to have that personal trait. It's totally possible to be successful without having any talent at all.
2. IQ matters. It's one of those things that so-called elitists love to ignore while they also are the ones with high IQs. It makes them feel good about themselves. It writes a better story. It was all my hard work. 
3. Parenting matters, but not too much. So we shouldn't feel too bad about being a horrible parent (most parents are horrible ones these days. They seem to love their phones more than their own children) A few things you need to do with your children. As they get older, they don't need that much your attention. But when they ask for it, give it a 100%. Support them 100%. If you don't, nobody will.
4. Practice does matter by lots and lots.

So here is the thing.

Your life-long goal is to reach your "full" potential. And full potential is different for everyone. If you have higher IQ or stronger body, you will excel in academics or sports better than others who have lower IQ and weaker body. You just have to accept that. You can't be anything you want to be. But you can be the best version of yourself. Figure out what you enjoy the most. Your brain tends to like things that it is good at. Then practice practice practice. Figure out better way to practice. You need to experiment with what works for you. I am a huge believer in memorizing as much as I can. Now I am mixing that up with "no more shalow knowledge."

I always tell my son, "The hare and the Tortoise" story isn't about tortoise's success. It's about the hare's utter failure." If the hare didn't take a nap, there is no way in hell the tortoise would've won the race. Not practicing is like taking a nap. Lesser or weaker people would catch up to you and pass by you if you do not practice. As long as you practice, they never will.
