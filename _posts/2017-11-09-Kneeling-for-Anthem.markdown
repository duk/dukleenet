If you get upset about NFL football players kneeling for anthem, you fall into one of these.

1. a racist
2. a dumbfuck
3. And most likely all of the above

Sometimes, I see a huge car with a huge Amercian flag on the way to work. And it's never a Prius or Tesla. It's this huge fucking American bulldozer Yukon gas-guzzling shit. And I can pretty much be deadon who is driving that car.
