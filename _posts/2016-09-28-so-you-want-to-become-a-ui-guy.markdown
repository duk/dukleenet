I want you to know these before getting into it.

1. You will have to deal with bikeshedding problems a lot; every person has opinions about how UI should look; they can't really say anything about
what they can't see such as API codebase, but when it comes to ui, everybody has opinions. That can get annoying. You need to learn how to not take
this personally.

2. You are the first one to get blamed for or praises for. People don't truly understand where the bugs lie. All they see is a website not working. So
be ready for that.

3. Browser support issues.

4. Misconception that it's easy. I think it's easy to get started, but hard to master. But what's not right?
