Somehow it's taboo to scold someone else's child these days. But I do scold other kids. Specially when they are in my house or my car or on my property. It's okay that you just want to come to my house and relax and let your horrid kids to be my problem, but you will have to accept the fact that your kids will get yelled at if they do not behave.
