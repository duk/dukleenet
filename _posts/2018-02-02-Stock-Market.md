I sold all my stocks when Trump became the President. But stock market just kept going up. Specially the ones I had; Google, Amazon & Microsoft. I am not sure about Microsoft, but I still believe Amazon and Google are undervalued.

Today, the market hit a nosedive. And I think the market will adjust HARD. And I am very excited about it.
