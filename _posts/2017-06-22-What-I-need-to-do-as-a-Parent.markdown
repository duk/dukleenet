Pay attention to what everyone says on a big stage; they thank their parents for their support. And that's what every parent needs to do. Support your children. Hopefully they will love something that they are good at. If you see a potential, you just need to support your kids. That's all you need to do as a parent. 

Sometime, I feel like I take parenting too seriously. That window of opportunity where they need your full attention is pretty small. I would say between 1 to 7 or 8. Then they will try to figure out on their own. Then when they need your attention or support, you give them that 100%.
