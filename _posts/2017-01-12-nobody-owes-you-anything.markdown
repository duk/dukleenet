So we had some kids over last week or so and my son didn't want to play with them. And I could see that irritated their father. But I didn't go out and tell my son to play with them. If he doesn't want to play with them, so be it.

When someone doesn't want to play with you, you have to evalute a few things.

Why is it that he doesn't want to play with me? And go fix that. Maybe he doesn't like the way you play. Maybe you guys are just too different. Remember. Only social setting that should force someone to collaborate is your work. You don't hang out with people you don't like. Why shoud children be any different?
