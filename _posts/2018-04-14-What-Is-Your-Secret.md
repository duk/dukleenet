My son is smart. No. He is really smart. Probably way smarter than your kid. And unlike you I have so many data to prove that. Anyway, after my son won Contra Costa county Bee, someone asked my wife, "what is your secret?"

Here are some our secrets that I can think of.

1. He was born that way. He got lucked out with mysterious gene combination from me and my wife. 
2. We do OK. We are not super poor. So he got lucky there as well.
3. We as parents do sacrifice a lot for the sake of our kids. I never see you guys donate your time to volunteer in your son's class. Your son gets dropped off at daycare when it opens at 7 and gets picked up at 6:30 when daycare closes. You decided to put your career ahead of your kids. 
4. You are lazy as fuck. I know giving an iPad to your kid is the easiest parenting to do, but don't blame your kids when they don't turn out the way you want them to be; you didn't put in your time. 

I work at not so great company. Go check their glassdoor reviews. They are hilarious and sadly true most of times. But I get out at 5 and be home at 5:20. I am at my kid's school events cheering for my kids and you are nowhere to be found; you had to be in a meeting that doesn't matter to anyone. I know. But you work at this prestigious company so and so. 

Think about this. You think people will talk about where you worked when you die? They will talk about what kind of children you raised. Your kids are your best work. So get to "real" work.
