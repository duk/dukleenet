I personally think a unix admin is a great job.

1. Core Unix hasn't been changed for years.
2. The demand has never been higher due to the Cloud explosion.
3. I don't think learning curve is that steep if you are coming from programming background.
4. You don't really have to have computer science degree. 
5. Less ageism. I see a lot more older unix admins around than older developers.
