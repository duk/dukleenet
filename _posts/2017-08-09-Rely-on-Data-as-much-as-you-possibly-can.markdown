I bet this thing happens a lot to you as well.

Your coworker tells this coworker is smart/good or that coworker is dumb/bad.

When you badmouth someone, you gotta be really careful. You do not know what the listener thinks of you. He/she might not like you that much. So people try to tell me this and that about person whom I do not know. First, I don't get why people do that like I have no brain to judge people myself.

Here is how much brain process when someone tells me so-and-so is good/smart whatever.

1. Is this guy smart? If no, I disregard his/her opinion on pretty much everything. As a matter of fact, I disregard anyone's opinion.
2. The subject that he is referring to. What was my first impression of him? What school did he go to? Yeah, sounds shallow, but it's a proven method to evaluate smart/good.
