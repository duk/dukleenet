How many people do you know whom you can say 'wow he was some shitty kid back in school, but now he is such a successful man.' In my experience, I do not know that many of those ones. Smart kids were always smart. And most of them turned out good. A few months ago, someone my wife knew back in highschool came to visit. She told me he was super succesful and rich. But back in the days, he was a poor student from not so great home. He is an outlier. You shouldn't plan your future or your kids future based on outliers. We keep telling ourselves these lies because we want quick return. That's why we buy lotto tickets as well.

Success requires luck. But your life should focus on increasing that probability. My guess is that luck happens to a guy who went to Stanford than to a guy who didn't go to college a lot more often than not. Being a parent is so interesting to me; I see quite a handful of different types of kids through my own kids. I have my guess on how each one of them would turn out and hopefully I get to actually see how they do turn out.

Here are some of my guesses

1. fidgety kids won't turn out great.
2. kids who play electornics a lot won't turn out great.
3. Kids who has father who are workaholic won't turn out great.


If you are a parent, try to rely on data not intuition. Here is the thing. Most kids including mine and yours will be average at best. Everything in life crowded in the middle. We all hope that our kids are "special", but the fact is they are ordinary at best.
