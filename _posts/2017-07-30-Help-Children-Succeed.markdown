Just finished reading ["Help Children Succeed"](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0544935284/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_dp_T1_NAMFzbE55CS2Y). Unfortunately it's one of those books that doesn't have concrete answers. Anyway, this is what I've collected so far from reading all these parenting books.

Educators and psycologist want to "believe" that any student of any person can overcome and become whoever want to be. But is it really a honest answer?

We first need to recoginze a few things.

1. Born into a better family helps a lot.
2. Born into a race that controls that society helps a lot. If you are born white in European, America or Australia you will have much easier life. That's a fact.
3. Your gene matters.
4. Your IQ matters.
5. Your environment matters. And your environment tends to be better if your answer to number 1 is yes.

So the bottom of the book is this; a lot has to do with what happens at home of the child so it's very difficult to help out.

This is what I think you should do as a parent.

1. Your goal is to help your child to reach his/her ceiling. And ceilings vary per a child. He/she can't be anybody he/she wants to be; first, genes have a lot to do with inherited intelligence. And second, luck has a lot to do with someone's success.
2. Provide them opportunities. They will like what they are good at. Remember your kid just needs to be super good at one thing, then he/she will be fine.
3. Pay attention when your kids need your attention. Get the fuck off your phone. You are risking your kids future over your so-so friend's dinner plate pic. That's kinda sad and make you a horrible dumb fuck. STOP DOING THAT. Your kid doens't need that much attention. You just need to give it when he/she needs it.
