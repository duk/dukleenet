>Margaret Pennoyer, an elementary school teacher in Manhattan, had just returned from a bachelorette party in Napa Valley when she received an email that had been sent to all the guests. The two organizers had itemized each womanâ€™s individual expenses, which they had covered, and requested reimbursement through Venmo, an app that transfers money between users who have linked their bank accounts to their phones. Ms. Pennoyer owed $31.98 to one woman and $20.62 to the other.

My wife was invited to this thing one time with younger generation and what they do for any event is to split everything. For example, if you are invited to a BBQ party, the host is just providing his/her place. And he/she might cook but the cost has to be splitted. I don't know what to make out of it. I think that's cool, but don't expect to grow a deep relationship out of it. But then I am not really big on "friendship" so I guess nothing to lose there.

I am an old fart and in Korean culture older person is kinda expected to pick up all the taps. And that's in my opinion fucked up culture. So I am supposed to pick up a tab for somehow who is a year younger till I die? 

This is what I have observed; people take advantage of that. I never ever seen these young folks that I was forced to pick up the taps passing that tradition down. And I am fucking sick and tired of paying for everyone. That's why I try not to go out with anyone who is younger than me anymore. I am just too scared and tired of picking up tabs. Now we have free loader problem. 

I love the idea of splitting everything. Bue I am warning you; you will never find a real friend that way. Only couple of friends that I have left are the ones that pick up the next tab when I pick up the tab before.

I am sure the article was written by someone who takes an advantage of the system. It's amazing how actually cheap people call more generous people cheap when they stop getting benefits.
