I read articles off hacker news. There are some good articles linked from it which I believe useful most of time. But I sometimes make mistakes of reading comments. And they are hot garbage. Oh boy. I thought I was a negative dick. But not compared to these fuckers. 

I really do not care for opinions of some average Joe's. If you are giving me an advice of some sort, I might be knodding and shit like that to try to fool you, but I am already checked out in my head. Just do not care about what they say, write if they are nobody. I don't care. It's just waste of my time.
