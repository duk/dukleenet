If your kids are shitty, I have zero respect for you as a person. But she is a CEO of so-and-so. I could care less. You fucked up the most important thing as a person; raising a child right.

Not all kids are born with good genes. I get it. But it's our job to teach them how to be civil. After all, we live in a society. I really do not know what to do when I see a shitty kid. I personally do not care about other kids until it becomes my problem. And again and again I found out that they are shitty for a reason; their parents are shitty. Shitty produces shitty. 

I am done with dealing with shitty kids. My job is to keep these shitty fuckers away from my kids regardless how close they are supposed to be to me.
