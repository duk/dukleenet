I've concoluded when it comes to health nobody really understands nutrients and body. Now I see people slamming Tom Brady's T-whatever method as pseudoscience.

This is what I came up with after reading numerous books on health, diet and food.

1. Trust your eyes. Trust "common sense."
2. Read two books. "In Defense of Food" and "Dorito Effect." These don't claim to be scientific. But it makes sense.
3. Don't go global. There is no absolute truth. There might be, but let's not care about that. What you care is for you to be healthy.
4. Experiment with your body. Write down what you had how you felt and how you slept and so forth. Figure out what food does what to your body.
5. Probably processed food can't be good for you. It's one of those things that your body and brain send warning signals. You just have to listen to them.
6. Rich fuckers and big fucking corporations will do whatever it takes to take money off your hand and increase profit. When they are in food business, you know what they are going to do. They will whatever to make money. They do not care about your health. Act accordingly.

Of course, my 2018 goal is to lose weight again. And it's been working well so far. What you are looking for is to get your body to a place where hunger is tolerable. When I am fat, I can't stand being hungry. But now I can skip lunch and I am okay with it. And I do not overeat at a dinner table.

1. No bread. No processed food.
2. Be easy on yourself. A few setbacks are okay.
3. 12 hour food free. If you had dinner at 7 pm, do not eat anything still 7 am next day.
4. moderate exercise to go with your new diet. I have two dogs and I walk them. So that helps. Get a dog if you don't have one. Probably the best decision I've ever made in my life.

And now I am trying to slowly get off coffee. Read a few articles and want to experiment how my body is without caffeine in it. I've noticed most non coffee drinkers that I know sleep pretty well whereas I am such a light sleeper. So I want to find out if getting off coffee makes any difference.
