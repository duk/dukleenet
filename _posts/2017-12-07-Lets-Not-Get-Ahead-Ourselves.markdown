Let's say you and I are working at a shitty company. And you come to me and tell
me so-and-so on this so-and-so team is so fucking smart. That can't be true. He
is working at a shitty company where you and I work at. Don't get me wrong. He
might be smart. But I do not have a data to back that up.

Folks, I need data to back anything up. If you are a parent, you probably know a
kid that other parents constantly bring up to say how smart he/she is. Sorry.
you don't have data to back that up. I might nod and shit, but that shit goes
into one ear and out the other. Let's wait the fuck up till they get to a
college. I love college admission season; it's that time of year where parents
stop bragging about their kids. They go from "my son is super smart" to
"so-and-so college (fill in any not so great college or a college you never
heard of) is a good college and really strong at 'whatever my kid will major
in'"

data isn't 100% guaranteed. But it is something. If someone went to Stanford, I
would be more willing to give him/her benefit of doubt. Of course, you have to
add their personal circumstances and what not. So if you want me to tell me
something, bring data with you. Or I will just ignore you. I mean I will pretend
that I care or some shit like that, but I would be thinking about a movie I
watched last night or I would just go through my visual flashcards in my head.

So let's not get ahead ourselve, please.
