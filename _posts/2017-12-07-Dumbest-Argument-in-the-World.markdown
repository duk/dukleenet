If you ever bring this argument up during "social media is bad for you" debate,
you are dumb as a door knob.

'They said the same thing about books back in the days'

You have to recognize that you just compared Ernest Hemingway's novel to your
friend's kid piano recital video.

Yeah, you are a dumbfuck.
