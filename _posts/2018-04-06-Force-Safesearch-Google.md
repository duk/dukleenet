If you haven't searched for "naked women" on Google image search, go try right now. It's insane. You can turn on safesearch feature at browser level, but any kid can bypass that by opening up Chrome in incognito mode. So I was digging around a bit and found out that you could redirect www.google.com to forcesafesearch.google.com at dns level. In order to do that you need to update your hosts file. Open it up and add the lines below. That's it.
