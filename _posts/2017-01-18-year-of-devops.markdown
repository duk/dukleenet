1. Find out what you are good at. Pick more than one. You can't be just good at one. You might be "great" at one. But you can be good at many things.
2. List all the things you are good at.
3. Cross out ones that require too many dependencies on others. For example, software development has too many dependencies, I would avoid it unless you are "great" at it.
4. So now you only have jobs that would you give you autonomy; the fewer dependencies you have the more autonomy you have.
5. And get rid of ones that look easy, but hard. Pick the ones that look hard, but easy.
5. So now you have jobs that give you autonomy and make people think difficult.
6. Get rid of ones that require too much "domain" knowledge. 
7. Now you have jobs that give you autonomy, look difficult and better empployable.
8. Get rid of ones that require constant learning. Don't get me wrong, you should be learning all the time. But you don't want to be learning new things all the freaking time either. You will need that time to be an expert on a subject than become jack of all trades master of none. And pick a subject matter that has proven that it can withstand time. (e.g. Unix system.)
9. Then pick the ones that get you frequent positive feedback from your coworkers and employers. The ones that show your impact immediately and frequently.
