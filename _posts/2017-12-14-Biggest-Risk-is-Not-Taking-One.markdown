I've been going back and forth on this, but I am going to go ahead and try. Year 2018 will be the year when I make a career switch. Currently I am a UI engineer; I do JavaScript/css/html and some backend stuff. And I think I am pretty good at it. So why the change?

Here are the problems that I have seen being a UI guy.

1. Since anyone can see it, everyone has an opinion on how UI should look. I mean every fucking person.
2. Too many people think UI is a easy shit.
3. UI position gets interviewed as if it's a system engineer position. They will ask you about alogrithms, data structures, graph theory and what not. After going through vigorous interviews, you always get this 2nd class citizen treatment.
4. And it gets hard to keep up with new technology that all these dumb people fall in love with just to see it become obsolete in a few years. you waste tons of time learning stuff that would eventually become obsolete.

To sum up, UI has this problem.

1. It is hard, but looks easy.
2. It's never done/not done. There is always something. color is off. font is small. 
3. Too many things to master and no respect.

So I am trying to slowly switch to become a Cloud guy.

1. It's not that hard, but looks hard. 
2. Many people think it's hard shit.
3. People will have hard time looking over your shoulder to make comments. So you get autonomy which bring fun at what you do.
4. Instant gratification and recognition. 
5. Unix hasn't been changed for years and going strong and will be there till the end of time. You don't have to learn new technology every fucking year like you have to in UI field. So you can actually focus on mastering what you already know.
6. I see quite a few old folks in sysops and cloud field, not so much in ui field. 
7. I can differetiate myself from other devops with my strong ui skills. I can quickly build up monitoring application for a team or something. I can use my ui skill to stand out.
