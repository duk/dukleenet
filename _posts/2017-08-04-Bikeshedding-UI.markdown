So the thing about UI is that every fucking person has an opinion. So here are the list of people that I would listen to when it comes to UI.

1. Steve Jobs. But he is already dead.
2. People with UX credentials. Either you are an excellent UI designer or graduated with some sort of degree in UX.
3. Actual users who would use my products.

Other than that, I would just ignore your opinion. I've worked and seen enough work that I know what I am doing. So I do not need your personal UI opinion.
