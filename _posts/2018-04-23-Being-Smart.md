Have you met a person who went to a pretty good school but you thought to yourself 'how the heck did he go to that school?' Simple answer. He/she is that tortoise in that story and there are a lot of tortoises in the world. These are the people who were born with good "character" genes such as resiliency or they had tiger Mom or tiger Dad. 

You can be trained to go to a good school.

But here is the thing. Without a real brain power, you will never be "creative."

These tortoises will  get a good job making a good living. Nothing is wrong with that. But they won't be able to change the world; they do not have brain for it. Creativity can' be achieved by hard work. Tortoises lack problem solving skills. They can't really handle "new" challenges. If something goes a bit off the script, they will get stuck. 

Here is a fun fact as well. When I went to an info night for my son, they put up this slide showing characteristics of "gifted" child and one stood out; "funny." Have you met a dumb person who was funny?
