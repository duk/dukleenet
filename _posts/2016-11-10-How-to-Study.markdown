I am still trying to figure out how I spend my free time well. Now I am reaching a point where even watching a movie feels like huge waste of my time.
So I go to sleep early and wake up early, but I don't really utilize my free time well. And the biggest issue is that I do not know what to do.

So here is my plan.

First, I have three levels of focus: high, medium, and low. "High" means I have laser sharp focus. 

Then, I create tasks under these three focus levels. For example, reading an algorithm book would require "high" focus. Reading a programming book would require “medium” focus. Learning unix command line or touchtyping would require “low” focus. 

Everyday I start with “high” focus work. About 5 minutes in, you will know what type of focus you have for that moment. If you are not in “high” mode, quickly switch your gear down to “average” stuff. If you are not in that mode, again switch down to “low”. 

Import thing is to have the tasks ready for all three mental state. If you don’t, you will wander off browsing the Web and buying things online.
