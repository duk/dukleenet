People keep telling me what type of person they are. Do not tell me. Show me. Your words mean nothing to me.

Someone told me yesterday that she "trusts" people. First, do not put yourself in a position where you have to "trust" someone. I am not saying you should be suspicious of everyone. "Trust" is a dependency. The path to happy life is to remove as many dependency as possible. "Trust" is type of "expectation" and expectation creates anxiety and disappointment. Don't trust anyone.

I hope she didn't see me rolling my eyes when she told me she was a good worker. It's not that I don't think she is a good worker; I do not care whether she is or not. That's not my job.

Everybody needs to know this. You live in "your world" and I live in "my world" and everybody lives in "their world." Nobody really truly cares about you unless she gave a birth to you. So confiding in someone is pretty pointless.

Anyway, I've seen two ways to succeed in corporate world. Either you learn how to bullshit really well or be really good at what you do. Bullshit requires many other things like your personality, your race, your sex blah blah blah. So if you are not equipped with those, I will stick with trying to be really good at what you do. Great companies have less of bullshit ones and more of really good at what they do ones. So go work there.

Don't tell me. Please show me.
