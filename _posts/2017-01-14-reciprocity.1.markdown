splitting a tap is convinient, but reciprocity is a great measure stick when it comes to find out about a person. Any good relationship needs to be reciprocal. If not, it fails. So start picking up a tap. See if the other person remembers that you did and he/sh picks up a tap the next time you guys eat out. To me, that tells a lot about that person.

So whenever you see me picking up a tap for you, just remember that I am just doing a social experiment on you.
