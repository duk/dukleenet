I listen to The Herd with Colin Cowherd. During NBA season, he blasted Russell Westbrook for hugging a ball too much and mocked him with his record-setting Triple doubles declaring a triple double that does not translate into a win has no meaning. Then the NBA finals came. Then he changed his tune when Lebron James did the exact same thing that Russell Westbrook did. Colin went from "Triple Double doesn't matter when the team doesn't win" to "What more can James do?? He is scoring triple double every night!" 

O.K. 

There is only one truth we know from his argument; he does not like Russell and he has man-crush on Lebron James. It's that simple. Any debate isn't about facts. It's about defending your belief by cherrypicking the ones that favor you and ignoring ones that don't. Everyone does the same thing. I do. You do. 

So the only thing you can do is to be aware what you are doing. Again, you cannot prevent you from falling into confirmation bias. You just have to be aware that you are doing it.
