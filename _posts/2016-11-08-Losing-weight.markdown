Just scanned through my weight chart and I was down at 169 lbs at some point this year. Now I am going back up at 184 lbs. 

I don't believe in exercising to lose weight, so I need to watch what I eat again. And I am going to read "In defense of Food" again to motivate myself.

1. No breads or noodles
2. Water only. No coffee either.
3. No achohol
4. No snacking.
5. No suger. Sugar should come from fruits only.
6. No processed food.
