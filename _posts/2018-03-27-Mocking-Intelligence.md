It's sad to see some people fucking up parenting especially when it's a family member or someone close to me.

Here are some signs that you are a horrible parent.

1. You let your kids use electronics as much as they want. 
2. Your kids are fat.
3. Your kids are bullies.
4. You utter "boys being boys" nonsense all the fucking time.
5. You don't apologize to other parents when your fucked up child do some stupid fucked up shit in their house.
6. You are a horrible person yourself.
7. Your kids tend to mock smart kids and seem to be proud of being dumb as shit.

I can't fix your child and I don't want to. All I can do with my power is to keep your fucked up kids away from my kids.

And I will start doing just that regardless how close you are to me.

If you are a parent, raising your kid right should be your first priority not your fucking sad job that this world does not need.
