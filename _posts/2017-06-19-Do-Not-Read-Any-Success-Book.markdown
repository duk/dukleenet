I had to stop reading ["Barking Up the Wrong Tree"](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0062416049/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_dp_T1_uchszbMAHAHZQ) in the middle of first chapter.

I am guilty of reading one too many self-help books. I am genuinely curious about what others think of what success is or how people should live their life.

But this book is a type of books that I avoid. Most of stuff in it are stories of others. I get really annoyed and stop reading when a self-help book uses stories of likes of Bill Gates or Jeff Bezos or Steve Job or any famous people. I am not them. I will never be like them. You are not them. You will never ever become like them.

Every peron is consist of so many things. Genes that you got from your parents. Your upbrining. and so forth. So when I read a book talking about how famous people did this and did that, I get disgusted by it and usually stop reading.
