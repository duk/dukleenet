After spending days to figure out how to set ReactJS with webpack, gulp, yarn and etc etc etc, I came across this new tool called ["Svelte"](https://svelte.technology/) 
by [Rich Harris](https://twitter.com/Rich_Harris). Looks like he borrowed a lot of good ideas from Vue, Polymer and more.

If you take a look at "frameworks" or "libraries" that are gaining a lot traction these days, they promote "let's not reinvent too many things." Let's use CSS as CSS.
Let's use HTML as HTML. so I think "Web Component" is where this thing is heading.

Web development field was one of the rare places in IT world where it was inclusive. But now it's losing that touch. It's "too" academic. 
There is too much my way or high way.

The bottom line in web development is "users do not care what you do behind the scene as long as it's fast." So the only thing we need to agree on is that we 
need to make the web faster.

So I am thinking about giving "Svelte" a chance. And man, there are so much "Why the heck did you build yet another one?" Is that such a bad thing that we have
vast choices for our liking?
