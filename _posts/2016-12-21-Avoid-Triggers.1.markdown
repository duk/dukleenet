It's that time of year that we reflect on the year. My 2016 is pretty bad. I really didn't take care of my body. And failed to improve my personal trait.

And now I am wondering if that's even possible to change. Focusing on "change" ruins everything. Let's not focus on "change." That's too grand. That's too vague. 
That's too ambitious. That's why I always fail to change.

So in 2017, I will try to not to do certain things that expose my personal trait. From "chaging" to "not showing too often."

Sometimes, I get critical of others. I should stop doing that. And there is harder way and easier way. Let's compare that with smoking. It's hard to stop smoking
when you are around with smokers all the time. So my easier way to being not too critical of others is not to hang out with people too much. These days I go to work and put on my bose noise-cancelling headsets to minimize my iteraction with toxic folks.

As a person with weak willpower, I should focus on avoiding "triggers" at all cost.
