Last few days, I played with ReactJS. And now this thing has morphed into something super complex. I am not talking about ReactJS itself, 
but the ecosystem around it. It's safe to say last few days were just spent learning how to set up a dev environment using npm package, webpack and what not.

So tell me again. What was wrong with simple html and javascript?
