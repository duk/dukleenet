Do you really grok anything? Do you have this one subject that you are so confident?

Mastery leads to a good life. Without mastery, your life won't be much fun. If you are a developer like me, ask these questions to yourself.

1. Did you master your keyboard? Do you do touchtyping without constantly looking at your keyboard?
2. Did you master your IDE? Do you know all the shortcut keys? 
3. Did you master your technology stack? 

Masters always encourage us to just use what they created. In JavaScript world, they encourage us to use just React or Angular. That's how they hook you. That's how they make themselves famous and rich. Their intent might not be so, but the outcome is. 

Don't fall for that. You gotta get under the hood. Whatever the subject is, you need to be that guy that knows everything about it.
