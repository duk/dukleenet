Currently I am trying to improve on my vim chops. And touchtyping is a prerequsite for that. But the most difficult part of touchtyping for me is to push 0 with my right pinky. I don't know about other people's, but mine is a bit crooked inward. So it feels unnatural when I try to type "0" with my right pinky. So when I googled and found out a lot of people have same issue, it made me feel better. 

Anyway, what helped me is to move the entire right up to the number key pads rather than trying to pull up the right pinky alone.
