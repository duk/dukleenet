Republicans seem to be winning every election still. From my twitter feed, I almost bought into 'we are winning now' narratives. But then I realized that I live in such a tiny small bubble. I don't really consider myself an elitist, but I tend to lean towards left.

Anyway, what we really have to worry about is not that we are living in our own bubble. We really have to worry about why so many people are so dumb? Our bubble shouldn't be this small. There should be more educated people out there. I think it's years of shitty education system coming to fruition. Education should be absolutely free all the way to college. A nation shouldn't make money off education. 

People are so dumb now that they vote against what would benefit them. Think about it. They lack analytical skill so that only thing they can do is to watch Fox news and pointing fingers at people who don't look like them. Dumb people get brainwashed easily.

I really don't know how this country would get better with this many dumb people in it. And to all lefties, posting something on a social network does nothing. You added nothing. You improved nothing, but your ego. If you really care, get off social network and actually do something about it. Donate your time. Donate your money.
