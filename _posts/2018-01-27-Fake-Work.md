I think I need more than "I get paid." I was sitting in a meeting yesterday thinking 'wow we are bunch of adults and we are wasting our lives away pretending that we are doing something.' 

The harsh truth. What I do doesn't matter at all. What most people do does not matter. But we do and we rationalize. Then you can tell me, "you think too much again. The bottom line is simple. we go to work and we feed our family just like ants or bees. Just more steps and in different ways." 

But what ants do for a living does contribute to the society. Bees pollinate. So what they do to feed their young does have impact. They do add values to the society.

But what I do or what you do adds ZERO value. Sad!
