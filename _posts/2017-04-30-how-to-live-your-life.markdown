Recently I had an opportunity to observe someone just like me; always unhappy about something. Everything is somebody else's fault. So I would like to share how I think everyone should live their life. 

First, you need to figure out who you are. The eariler you do, the better off you are. I don't think anyone started off wanting to be a middle manager growing up. Being a manager isn't too bad, but it's like marrying someone because you are supposed to when you are 30. It's one of those things that people just do when they hit certain age.

That's what happens when you did not figure you out. You go to college because that's what you do when you are done with highschool. You marry because that's what you do when you are old enough. You have kids because that's what you do when you marry. You become a manager because that's what you do when you turn middle-aged.

That's 90+ percent of population. I couldn't even become a manager so I guess I am even worse off.

Find out what your strengths are and what your weaknesses are. Do more of your stengths and try to do less of your weaknesses. The only true way to succeed is to be you and play your strengths.

Second, try to have a "real" skillset. If you don't have real skill, you will have to depend on "other" skills. Those are unstable, demeaning, and exausting. They require constant ass-kissing, back-stabbing, bullshitting and so forth. Having real skill saves you from a lot of unnecessary stress.

Third, try to work with people who are compatible with you. That makes your career a lot more pleasurable.
