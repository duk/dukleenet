Lot of people say this a lot, "but I am happier." 

Honestly I can't validate how happy you are. So we will have to throw all these touchy feely metrics out the window.

The most important thing is to not care. Do not compare yourself to anyone. But if you say something like "but I am happier", that means you like to compare yourself to others.

So this is how I evaluate you.

First, you as a parent.

1. What university does your kid end up. Stop telling me how smart your kid is. And if you want to do that, you need to bring me real data. Only data I can validate is how well your kid is doing in her school. Nothing else.

Second, you as an employee or employer.

1. How much do you make?
2. How much freedom do you have? Do you waste hours commuting? Do you have flexible hours? Do you get to work from home?

Third, you as a person

1. Are you healthy?
