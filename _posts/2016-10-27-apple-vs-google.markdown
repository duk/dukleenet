A few days ago, I cancelled my pre-order for Google Pixel and ordered iPhone 7 Plus 256 gig. I didn't think Google's first attempt for a real
competitor against iPhone was ready enough for me. Its hardware spec is not quite up there with iPhone 7 plus and I guess Google tried to make
up for with its software. 

So I will stick with iPhone with all the Google apps on it for now. But I am sure Google will eventually get there in hardware department.
