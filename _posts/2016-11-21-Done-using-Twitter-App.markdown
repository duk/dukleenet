You know why I don't watch TV any more? I hate ads. And the twitter app is now a new TV. There is no way I can skip it. It's unfortunate that's the only way 
they can make money. But it's just too much. 

If you like Twitter, do what I do. Install "Firefox Focus" app on your iPhone. Then use web version of Twitter.
