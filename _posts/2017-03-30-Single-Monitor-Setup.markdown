A few day ago, I read an article about single monitor setup. The part that stuck out was the part where the author said it used to break his flow when he shifted from multi-monitor setup to his laptop. That made sense to me.

So last night I removed two monitors from my home office and started using just one 24 inch monitor. And everyone seems to say that investment on 4k monitor is money well spent. So I will try one 24 inch 4k monitor setting for awhile. I tried it at work yesterday and I actually did work a lot better and got a lot more work done. So we will see.
