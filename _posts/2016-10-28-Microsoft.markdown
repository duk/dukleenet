Microsoft is awesome again under the new management. How do I know? I have a surface book and it is the best laptop I've ever owned. And 
I wish I was good at illustration so that I have an excuse to buy a Surface Studio. 

Now a lot of their technology is open-sourced including .Net. .Net can now run on Linux. And don't be shocked when Windows machine becomes most
hipster developer's dev machines. Microsoft now has something called "Bash on Ubuntu" and it's actually a linux machine running on Windows Subsystem.

To me, that sounds like Trojan's horse. Slowly Microsoft will blur the lines between Windows and Linux. Think about that. Now you can run Powershell
on linux. All these things that Microsoft are currently doing is to entice developers back to them. 

If you think about it, Microsoft is trying to follow how Apple's "old" way. Make awesome hardware, give OS for free. But in my opinion Apple is 
done. It's big enough that it will last for awhile, but eventually Google, Amazon and even Microsoft will pass by them. Reason? Apple does not get cloud.

Now Microsoft haters are running out of execuse to hate Microsoft. 

As an old Microsoft stack guy, I am rooting for Microsoft.
