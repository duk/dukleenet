When someone comes and asks a question, I can find out in a second whether she came straight without struggling to figure out on her own or not. Respect someone else's time. Struggle through it. Try to figure out yourself. There is a wonderful thing called the Internet. Google it. Go to Stack Overflow. I always learn way more than my question when I start digging into it online.

If you are spoonfed by someone right off the bat, you will not learn anything.
