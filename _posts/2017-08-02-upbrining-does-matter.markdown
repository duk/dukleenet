My mom jokes about how she thought I was genius when I was a kid. Whenever she does that, I feel a bit like a loser. My IQ was 145 back in middle school and I remember my teacher asked me if anything was okay at home and why I wasn't doing what I was supposed to be doing; being academically successful.

I guess I turned out OK considering all the things that I went through. But I always feel like I should've been better off. I should've accomplished more. Losers like me always pretend that happiness and success are mutually exclusive. 'He's got a huge house, great job, and blah blah blah. But money doesn't bring happiness. I am happier.'

Are you really? First of all, you are comparing yourself. As long as you measure yourself to someone, you can't truly be happy.

I look at my son now and I see me. He is super smart. Probably way smarter than me. But he also has my 'don't wanna practice' gene as well. And only advantage he has against me is he has a better Dad.

Anyway, parenting isn't that hard if you think about it. You just have to appreciate your kids. You have to pay attention to your kid. As they get older, their need for your attention gets smaller and smaller. But when they do need it, you need to give it. Get excited about their "real" accomplishment. Do not patronize them.

But the scary thing about upbringing is that I didn't learn how to be a good Dad from my Dad. So everything that I do with my kids I really have to force myself into it. So I do understand my coworkers who rather stay in the office and browse internet than spending a few hours with their kids. Probably they had shitty Dad like me.
