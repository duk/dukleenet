People like rules. They try to make sense out of everything in life. They believe in math. That's why big data is huge right now. People arrogantly think that they can figure anything out if data is big enough. I doubt it.

Sometimes, feels like a right thing to do is way better than actual science. Eating junk food every day doesn't seem like a right thing to do for your health. You don't need science behind it. It just doesn't feel right. Eating lots of vegitables seems like a good idea. Eating too much meat doesn't feel right for me.
