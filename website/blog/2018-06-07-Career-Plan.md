# Career Plan 2.0

## How I am planning to switch my career 

1. Find a field where you see a lot of people of your age working.
2. Try to find a job where you either did the work or not did the work. Avoid ones with a lot grey area. People will have opinions. Avoid those jobs if you can.
3. Find a job that requires minimum teamwork. That way you control your own success.
4. Find a job in a field that has not changed for a while.
