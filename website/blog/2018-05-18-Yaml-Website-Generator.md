I personally do not like JSON. It's okay when it's flat, but when you start adding nested objects with arrays and what not, I am lost.

I like yaml. tab/space based structure. I think it's a lot more readable. And readability matters.

```yaml

site:
    name:My Website
    theme: My Theme
    layout: Three Columns
    
page: 
    name:
    route: /about
    
    

```
